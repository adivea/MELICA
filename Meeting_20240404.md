## Tommy has a kml file with shelters and shelter numbers, and 3 boxes of shelter documentation
## with the same numbers. He also has CF infrastructure, military stations, hospitals and other 
## spatial data.

## Expanded entrances can inform 2 different simulation models
## No actual exercises, as people would be afraid, no scaring the population;
## companies with >75 people have to make an emergency/fire plan, designate people, and equipment, 
## organize an exercise
## companies <75; family houses with 2+ families need to have a sikringsrum
## blocks of flats have firewardens who are trained, and equipped, but equipment is
## put out of sight
## villa quarters are assigned to self-organize a fire-emergency, 
## but it was voluntary during peace-time
##

## Emergency hospitals: 5 boxes in the Rigsarkivet, sygehusberedskabet,
## CF beredskabet: fire stations, schools for kids, 
## military locations: Tommy has hundreds
## Police stations for city evacuation
## no maritime evacuation, the plan is for 5 minute run to a shelters
## in US you have hours to evacuate by car, no need for shelters, 

## Currently, electrical code would probably prevent the use of the shelters
## Feasibility is problematic


## To DOes: 
## Ask Rosanna: CF committee meeting preparation papers 1950 - 1993
## Schedule a guided fieldtrip in June, and a data cleaning session
## scanning of the 3 shelter boxes from 1972 (lists contain maps)
