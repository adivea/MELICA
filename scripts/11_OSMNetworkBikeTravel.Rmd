# 1. Get OpenStreetMap data
In this step, we use the osmdata package to retrieve data from OpenStreetMap. This package basically provides an R interface to the Overpass API of OpenStreetMap. First, we set the Den Gamle By and draw a circular buffer around it with a radius of 3km, which will serve as our area of interest.

```{r setup_study_area}
venue <-sf::st_sfc(sf::st_point(c(10.193481442350198,56.15875458855773)), crs = 4326)
area <-sf::st_buffer(venue, units::set_units(3, "km"))
```

Now we query all streets within our area of interest from OpenStreetMap. In OpenStreetMap, streets are those features that have a value for the highway key. In R, they will be represented by an sf data frame with linestring geometries. Since some streets may be drawn as a closed polygon (like a square or a roundabout) we convert polygon borders into linestrings, before extracting only the linestrings from the API response. Finally, we cut streets at the edge of our area of interest and make sure all of them are single linestrings, meaning that the different parts of multi-linestrings will be seen as different street segments (note that to do this properly we first need to cast everything to multi-linestrings).

```{r query_osm_streets}
streets <- osmdata::opq(sf::st_bbox(area)) %>%
  osmdata::add_osm_feature(key = "highway") %>%
  osmdata::osmdata_sf() %>%
  osmdata::osm_poly2line() %>%
  purrr::pluck("osm_lines") %>%
  sf::st_intersection(area) %>%
  sf::st_cast("MULTILINESTRING") %>%
  sf::st_cast("LINESTRING")

# saveRDS(streets, "../data/aarhus_streets_osm.rds")
#streets <- readRDS("../data/aarhus_streets_osm.rds")
```


In a similar way, we also query all restaurant or gym locations within our area of interest. Whatever you wish to  serve later on as the destinations in our accessibility analysis. In OpenStreetMap, restaurants can be identified as those features having the value restaurant for the amenity key. They are represented as points instead of linestrings.

However, shelter locations do not yet exist in OSM, and so we will load our own points for public  (BTG) and private (SR) shelters (safe rooms/ fortified rooms).

```{r load_custom_point_data}
# sikringsrum from BBR
SR <- st_read("../output_data/SK_bbr_oc_addresses.geojson") %>% 
   st_transform(crs= 4326)
# betondaekning grave from fieldrecording, kommunens data, and CDC records
BTG <- st_read("../output_data/done20241012.geojson")
```

Let us look at the result: a circle of lines with SR represented by red points

```{r plot_area_with_custom_points}
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(sf::st_geometry(streets))
plot(sf::st_geometry(SR %>%st_intersection(area)), col = "red", pch = 20, cex = 0.5, add = TRUE)
plot(sf::st_geometry(BTG %>%st_intersection(area)), col = "orange", pch = 20, cex = 1, add = TRUE)
```

# 2. Estimate cycling travel times
In this step, we estimate cycling travel times for each street segment. These are computed (obviously) as length / speed. First, we compute the length in kilometers of the street segments.

```{r calculate_street_lengths}
streets$length <-sf::st_length(streets) %>%
  units::set_units("km")

plot(dplyr::select(streets, length))
```

For the cycling speed, we define a default speed which we adjust based on the gradient of the street segment. To do so, we first need to estimate the gradient of each street segment. This requires a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), which basically is a spatial grid covering an area and storing an elevation value for each cell. We use a DEM for Denmark with a 10m resolution, available as open data from the dataforsyning in EPSG 4326. You still need to crop the full version of it in the data folder of this repository, which we load with the raster package. To estimate gradients of linestrings with this DEM, we use the slopes package.

```{r estimate_street_gradients}
dem <- raster("../data/dem_Aarhus10m.tif") 
gradients <- slopes::slope_raster(streets, dem, directed = TRUE) * 100

```

Now we can set a speed of each street segment, based on its gradient. We use a default speed of 20 km/h. An uphill gradient decreases this speed, and a downhill gradient increases this speed, all until a given minimum and maximum speed of respectively 5 km/h and 30 km/h. For reasons of simplicity, we will just model a linear relation between gradient and speed, adapted from Parkin & Rotheram (2010).

```{r calculate_cycling_times}
estimate_speed <-function(gradient, default = 20, max = 30, min = 5) {
  ifelse(
    gradient < 0,
    min(default + 0.8 * abs(gradient), max), # downhill
    max(default - 1.4 * gradient, min) # uphill
  )
}

streets$speed <-sapply(gradients, estimate_speed) %>%
  units::set_units("km/h")

plot(dplyr::select(streets, speed))
```

Now we have the lengths and speeds computed, we can simply compute the estimated travel time of cyclists for each street segment, in minutes.

```{r define_cycling_suitability_function}
streets$time <-units::set_units(streets$length / streets$speed, "min")

plot(dplyr::select(streets, time))
```
# 3. Estimate cycling suitability
In this step, we assign each street segment a cycling suitability level. This should give an indication of how suitable the infrastructure is for cycling, in terms of safety and comfort. A common approach is to use four different levels of traffic stress, first introduced by Mekuria, Furth & Nixon (2012) and later applied in practice with differing implementations. Another approach is the NetAScore, and open-source project developed at the University of Salzburg that allows to compute a continuous bicycle suitability index based on OpenStreetMap data.

In this notebook, however, we use a simplified workflow serving as an example. It defines three different levels of cycling suitability based on the available cycling infrastructure and the street classification. Separated bike lanes form the highest level. Painted bike lanes, shared lanes, and residential streets form the intermediate level. Everything else becomes the lowest level.

```{r assign_cycling_suitability_levels}
estimate_suitability <-function(hw, cw, cwl, cwr, cwb, bc, ...) {
  lanes <-c("lane", "shared_lane", "share_busway")
  if (hw %in% c("cycleway")) {
    1
  } else if (hw %in% c("residential", "living_street")) {
    2
  } else if (cw %in% lanes | cwl %in% lanes | cwr %in% lanes | cwb %in% lanes) {
    2
  } else if (hw %in% c("footway") & bc %in% c("yes", "designated")) {
    2
  } else {
    3
  }
}

cols <-c(hw = "highway", cw = "cycleway", cwl = "cycleway:left",
         cwr = "cycleway:right", cwb = "cycleway:both", bc = "bicycle")

streets$level <-streets %>%
  sf::st_drop_geometry() %>%
  dplyr::select(any_of(cols)) %>%
  setNames(c("hw", "cw", "cwl", "cwr", "cwb", "bc")) %>%
  purrr::pmap_dbl(estimate_suitability) %>%
  factor(levels = c(1, 2, 3), labels = c("good", "medium", "low"))
```

```{r plot_cycling_suitability}
plot(dplyr::select(streets,level))

# same result     
plot(streets["level"])
```
```{r}
st_write(streets, "../data/aarhus_streets_enriched.geojson")
```

# 4. Construct a routable street network
In this step, we convert the street centerlines into a routable network structure. This basically means that we make it explicit which street segments share an endpoint, such that we know how streets are connected, and hence, how someone can travel from A to B. This can be done very easily with the sfnetworks package. Note that for now we simply assume each street can be traveled in both directions, and the network is therefore undirected.

```{r create_routable_network}
network <-sfnetworks::as_sfnetwork(streets, directed = FALSE)

par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(network, cex = 0.5)
```

However, streets in OpenStreetMap are not always mapped with a network structure in mind. It happens often that connected street segments cross each other without sharing an endpoint. This results in many disconnected sets of streets in the network, as shown below. Even our small network has over 5000 disconnected components, with the largest of them containing around 20% of all nodes.

```{r count_network_components}
tidygraph::with_graph(network, tidygraph::graph_component_count())
```

```{r analyze_network_connectivity}
node_count_all <-network %>%
  tidygraph::with_graph(tidygraph::graph_order())

node_count_largest <-network %>%
  tidygraph::convert(tidygraph::to_largest_component) %>%
  tidygraph::with_graph(tidygraph::graph_order())

round(node_count_largest / node_count_all * 100)
```

Luckily, the sfnetworks package contains functions to pre-process and clean networks. One of them is `to_spatial_subdivision()`, which connects streets when they share internal vertices rather than only endpoints. This results in a network that still has some disconnected components (which is to be expected since we cut the network at the buffer boundaries), but with the largest of them containing almost all nodes.

Tip
There are many more network pre-processing and cleaning functions in sfnetworks. See the `sfnetworks documentation` for details.
```{r preprocess_network_connectivity}
network <-network %>%
  tidygraph::convert(sfnetworks::to_spatial_subdivision)

par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(network, cex = 0.5)

tidygraph::with_graph(network, tidygraph::graph_component_count())

node_count_all <-network %>%
  tidygraph::with_graph(tidygraph::graph_order())

node_count_largest <-network %>%
  tidygraph::convert(tidygraph::to_largest_component) %>%
  tidygraph::with_graph(tidygraph::graph_order())

round(node_count_largest / node_count_all * 100)
```

Now we can select the largest component without having to worry we loose a lot of data.
```{r select_largest_network_component}
network <-network %>%
  tidygraph::convert(tidygraph::to_largest_component)

par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(network, cex = 0.5)
```

# 5. Compute accessibility to restaurants
In this step, we compute a simple cumulative opportunities accessibility metric to find out how many shelters can be reached from our venue within a given time threshold. For that, we use sfnetworks to compute travel times between the venue and all shelters, and select those shelters that are accessible within the time threshold. The threshold we use is 15 minutes.


Let's check if data is ready for time calculation:
```{r validate_network_data}
# Are all geometries valid?
any(!st_is_valid(network))

# Inspect the network for NaN values in the "time" weights
any(is.na(network %>% activate("edges") %>% pull(time)))

# List edges with NaN time values
network %>%
  activate("edges") %>%
  filter(is.na(time)) %>%
  as_tibble()

#Filter out invalid edges (e.g., NaN values in the "time" attribute)
valid_network <- network %>%
  activate("edges") %>%
  filter(!is.na(time))  # Keep only edges where time is not NaN
#saveRDS(valid_network, "../data/aarhus_network_osm.rds")
```


```{r plot_network_elements}
plot(dem)
plot(streets["time"], add = TRUE);
plot(streets$geometry)
plot(BTG|>st_intersection(area), add =TRUE); 

```

```{r compute_accessibility_to_shelters}
times <-valid_network %>%
  sfnetworks::st_network_cost(venue, BTG|>st_intersection(area), weights = "time")

access <- BTG[which(times < units::set_units(6, "min")), ]

nrow(access)

par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(valid_network, cex = 0.5)
plot(sf::st_geometry(access), col = "orange", pch = 20, cex = 2, add = TRUE)
plot(venue, col = "red",pch = 20, cex = 2.5, add = TRUE)
```


That is a lot of shelters! But we used the whole network in the analysis, while some street segments are not suitable for cycling according to our index. If we only consider the first and second suitability level, results already look much different. We cannot get to any shelter!

```{r refine_accessibility_by_suitability}
suitable_network <- valid_network %>%
  tidygraph::activate("edges") %>%
  dplyr::filter(level %in% c("medium", "good"))

times <- suitable_network %>%
  sfnetworks::st_network_cost(venue, BTG %>% st_intersection(area), weights = "time")

access <- BTG[which(times < units::set_units(15, "min")), ]

nrow(access)
```


```{r}
trimmed_suitable_network <- suitable_network %>%
  tidygraph::activate("nodes") %>%
  dplyr::filter(!tidygraph::node_is_isolated())

par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(network, col = "grey", cex = 0.4)
plot(trimmed_suitable_network, cex = 0.5, add = TRUE)
plot(sf::st_geometry(access), col = "orange", pch = 20, add = TRUE)

```

And if we find only separated bike lanes to be acceptable, no sheltering for us!

```{r}
suitable_network <- valid_network %>%
  tidygraph::activate("edges") %>%
  dplyr::filter(level %in% c("good"))

times <- suitable_network %>%
  sfnetworks::st_network_cost(venue, BTG %>% st_intersection(area), weights = "time")

access <- BTG[which(times < units::set_units(15, "min")), ]

nrow(access)
```

```{r}
trimmed_suitable_network <- suitable_network %>%
  tidygraph::activate("nodes") %>%
  dplyr::filter(!tidygraph::node_is_isolated())

par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(network, col = "grey", cex = 0.4)
plot(trimmed_suitable_network, cex = 0.5, add = TRUE)

```

# Remarks
## 1. We simplified a lot
In this notebook we often used simple examples. In reality, accessibility of urban street networks is much more complex, with many factors at play.

## 2. We only touched upon the tip of the R iceberg
We showed a few R packages that are useful in the analysis of urban street networks. However, there are much more out there. The transport planning community in R is full of nice and talented people that share great work. Some examples:
