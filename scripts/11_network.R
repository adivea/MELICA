#Create a Network Graph

#Convert the street network into a graph object that can be used for network analysis.

#Calculate Shortest Path Distances

# Calculate shortest path distances from each residential parcel to each shelter.

#Incorporate Shelter Capacity

# Use a loop or apply function to allocate population to shelters 
#considering their capacity.

# Assess Spatial Equity

# Calculate spatial equity metrics such as the Gini coefficient or Moran's I.

# Calculate Gini coefficient
gini_coefficient <- ineq::Gini(parcels$distance_to_shelter)

# Moran's I for spatial autocorrelation of distances

#Visualize Service Areas

# Use buffer analysis to create service areas around shelters and 
#visualize them with respect to population density.

service_areas <- st_buffer(shelters, dist = 1000)  # Example 1km buffer

  tm_shape(service_areas) +

Identify Underserved Areas

# Overlay service areas with population density to identify underserved areas.

r
Copy code
underserved <- st_difference(parcels, service_areas)
underserved_areas <- underserved %>% 
  filter(population_density > threshold)  # Define your threshold

Summary of the Approach
Network Distance Measurement: Calculate shortest path distances between residential parcels and shelters using the street network.

Capacity Constraints: Allocate population demand to shelters based on their capacity, ensuring that once a shelter is full, the next closest shelter is considered.

Spatial Equity Analysis: Assess equity using Gini coefficient, Moran's I, or similar metrics to understand the fairness of the shelter distribution.

Adequacy Analysis: Use service areas and population density mapping to identify underserved areas where shelter accessibility is insufficient.

This approach allows for a comprehensive analysis of both the accessibility (spatial adequacy) and fairness (spatial equity) of the shelter distribution within Aarhus.
