Progress log

2023
April-May: field data collection with Lise, Maria, and Angel following architects' map > data cleansing

October: discovered missing data following Konstantina's review
and pulled it from a backup to create shelters 2023

2024
4 April 24: got kml from Timmy with all ~200 shelters he knows on the basis of archives, 50 of which he verified in GoogleEarth, and 150 which we can verify with shelters23 and in the field.

WORK IN PROGRESS:
- connect attributes to Tommy's shelters and compare with sh23
started on 24 April: Tommy's attributes are only partially relevant for sh23, only 50 overlap, the others refer to kommunens address list, so it needs a bit of tweaking

- collect data on the remaining unvisited shelters
intown (28) and outoftown datasets (~78) are ready for verification

TO DO: 
- export s and s_addresses as geojson so as to avoid re-processing
