Progress log

2023
April-May: field data collection with Lise, Maria, and Angel following architects' map > data cleansing

October: discovered missing data following Konstantina's review
and pulled it from a backup to create shelters 2023

2024
4 April 24: got kml from Timmy with all ~200 shelters he knows on the basis of archives, 50 of which he verified in GoogleEarth, and 150 which we can verify with shelters23 and in the field.

24 April
- started working on connecting attributes to Tommy's shelters and compare with sh23
BUT : Tommy's attributes are only partially relevant for sh23, only 50 overlap, the others refer to kommunens address list, so it needs a bit of tweaking

- made map of TOmmy's shelters and rerun Shelter Shiny app wtih more conditions ( type of transport and travel time)! DONE

30 April
- loaded Aarhus BBR data >> but no sikringsrum so need to engage Tommy & Rosanna
- re-exported shapefile, geojson shelters as the previous exports had truncated column names

TO DO: 
- export s and s_addresses as geojson so as to avoid re-processing : STARTED But not as straightforward, only 50 shared features
- gaps analysis
- need sikringsrum!
- collect data on the remaining unvisited shelters
intown (28) and outoftown datasets (~78) are ready for verification


2025
- fieldwork nearly completed for remaining features, add notes on Fieldmark recording to Andreas' data
- Tommy and kommunens' data is all verified
- BBR private shelters also verified
- gaps analysis with BDG is in progress but spread between 12_SpatialEquity and 14_Acess_RQ1.Rmd, needs separation; needs inclusion of KOB
- gaps analysis with SR is needed
